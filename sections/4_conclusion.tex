\section{Results}
\hspace{\parindent}As Table 1 shows, the optimized GPU implementation provides a staggering speedup compared to the CPU implementation. It also seems to show that for input sizes too small, the overhead of using the GPU reduces the amount of performance gained by a lot, as shown that n=10k resulted in under half the amount of speedup compared to n=100k. Table 2 shows that all block sizes except the largest are roughly equivalent.
